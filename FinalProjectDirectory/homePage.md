# Country's Carbon Dioxide Emissions Related to GDP Per Capita and Population

*****

Emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, have significantly increased since the industrial revolution, largely as a result of human activity. As population and economic growth have continued, so too have emissions. In recent years, however, there have been examples of decoupling of emissions and economic growth, with emissions leveling off or falling in many countries even as their economies have continued to grow. There are a number of factors behind this decoupling, including increased energy efficiency, the switch from coal to natural gas in power generation, and the growth of renewables.

Unfortunately, this is not consistent with every country as some of them have increased their emissions as we have gone forward in time. Some countries are not at that stage where they are ready to be more climately aware, and are still sacrificing our world's health for their progress.

How is this growth quantified though? We use a comparison of increase in population and GDP per capita over time to measure a country's progress, and then relate that back to their co2 emissions. We are looking for trends and methods in order to evaluate whether or not a country is in a state that is damaging the environment.

On our webpage you can look through and compare co2 emissions per capita and see the breakdown of co2 emissions by source in each country. This can all be done on multiple interactive maps where you can change the country and year to see the date and country of your choice. Through our prediction model, we are predicting whether or not a country will be likely to be a high or low risk at producing a lot of co2.
