## Brief technical report

Our methodology for the app was obviously based around our knowledge with the shiny package. We also used previously learned course material to clean our data set as well as merge the multiple data sets we had. We mutated and manipulated our data in ways that would allow us to present the information in the way that we wanted to. For the visuals we used models from class and what we had performed in previous homeworks and mini projects. This allowed us to create our worldwide map, source breakdown, and timescale. We then used what we had learned in regards to machine learning to create a predictor model using cluster at the end. After finishing these steps we figured out the best way to present it in shiny while making the neccessary adaptions. Overall there were numerous libraries and references that we made in this final project that were from material learned in this class.
